tablet view:
menu bar at the top has scores/status/time/yourmove (2 lines) with hamburger button, drops down for 4 buttons, all but play
board slightly smaller
clicking on a tile brings up a bottom bar., has a big right/down arrow, click on that switches it. then just pick letters

option to add tiles without dragging, just clicking, might also support IE then
make a tablet view, fix width problem/resizing

put the appcache back?
----------------------------------------
some words are comming up twice in aw if I have the same letter twice... might be worth removing if they're long
if the computer has blanks we'll have to add another one and do the loop 26 times, but it's 650 times for 2 blanks. uggh. might have to do a random thing in there
if I can't get it I should split the messages into my turn and it's turn

I think I just thought of how to do the algorithm fast.
all words go into array's 
a[p][p][l][e] = apple
start with each letter, check all the remaining letters, ect.  then if i get to the end and I have a blank I could check each letter...
just not sure how to code it. probably array's aren't the best idea
some sorta smart recursive function like the one I was almost working with for anagrams
function(sofar,count) {
var goforit = function(sofar,count) {
goallen = count - 1
for (a=0;a<goallen;a++) {

}
}
}
